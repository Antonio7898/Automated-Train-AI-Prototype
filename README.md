# Automated-Train-AI-Prototype
So , basically this fuzzy control system is just an AI prototype for an automated train  , ie a train which runs by its own on the basis of 2 input parameters 
 * Distance from the signal (in km) 
 * Color of the signal (red , green or yellow )  
 
 On the basis of given input parameters  , this system dynamically changes the speed of train which is the output (in kmph)  
* If the signal color is red  , then train stops just before it . 
* If it is yellow then it stops at the upcoming station . 
* It turns green it surpasses the upcoming station.
